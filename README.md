# XojoWeb_StaticContent
Serve static content from your Xojo Web app. Especially useful in standalone and load balanced environments.

This is a drop in module that extends the 'App' object of your Xojo Web project making integrating it super simple.

The example project demonstrates two distinct static folders with a PDF, image, and text file. It demonstrates how to map the folders and the Xojo Web app presents links to test the functionality very quickly.
